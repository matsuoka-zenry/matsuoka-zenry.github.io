        In the given text, a perceived city is described, detailing the character’s desire for a city. The text then reveals the character to arrive to the city in his old age. The main takeaway I found is the contrast in youth vs the old, and the desire vs reality. As seen later, the old quad, and the perspectives are split between these concepts, with one focusing on the youth/desire, and the other focusing on the old/reality.

        A 3d model of the old quad was made in rhino. The bays were arranged into a 3 by 3 array and were then manipulated, limited to the geometry of the original quad. Apart from manually moving individual elements, Boolean cuts were made to get less blocky separations, as well as the bend function.

        Perspective 1 details the youth, and the desire for a city. Bright lighting is used to show excitement for the city, with bright futures perceived. The framing has a lopsidedness to the left to show a subtle warping in their perspective. Additional rubble falling in the background show the narrow sightedness of the character.
Perspective 2 shows the present city, with the figures sitting in remorse whilst chaos of the city ensues around them. Additional motion blur was added to exaggerate this chaos of the city. The figures chosen are both focused on themselves, lost in their own minds rather than appreciating the city they have arrived to.

        The quad is split into two main sections, the lower ‘youthful’ section and the upper city. Following the main directional arrow starting from the bottom, there are temporal stitching lines connecting the two sections together. Glance arrows are used to show the warping/bending of the geometry, which in a sense show the warping of the characters perspective. In the city, there is a circle to notate the atmosphere of remorse in the city. This feeling of remorse in the city is further explored in the renders.

        The fourth module of the subject found us modeling and transforming the old quad from the University of Melbourne guided by a text about a city. While the transformation of the model was quite enjoyable, I found it was a bit limited by the initial model itself, as the task had us replicating the exact same model as in the workshops. The task then has us creating 2 perspectives and an annotated isometric view. In reflection, I could have spent less time tinkering with the model itself and focused more on the annotations of the isometric. The perspectives were quite an interesting task, combining the use of rhino 3d renders with photoshops 2d collage. We were limited to the default material in rhino and were tasked to create the materials in photoshop. As a result of this I spent most of the time creating depth of field, motion blur and other lighting effects in the collage, meaning I didn’t add many other elements in the collage. Focusing more on adding elements that perhaps add to the story would have made for a more interesting perspective.
