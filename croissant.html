        Photos of the croissant were taken at various projections using a makeshift lightbox. Extra care was taken to make sure the photos were perfectly parallel with the top, side and front views. While it is impossible to take a photo without perspective, taking the photo at an appropriate distance as level as possible gives a good enough representation of the elevations and plan views.

        The photos were laid out, being carful to maintain a correct scale. Very little postprocessing had to be done as the photos came out well, and the background could easily be removed. A consistent convention for the line annotation was followed, and was reused for the drawings.

        Drawings were done of the different views using various techniques. Using trace paper over the photos ensured accuracy in replicating the views of the croissant. The side and front views were done using standard grey lead rendering techniques, focusing on the details in the folds as well as the overall shading to emphasize the depth of the flat drawing. The top view was done using a fine liner, which is more unfamiliar to me. The end result came out quite nicely, as the hatching with the fine liner allowed for great contrast. The views of the cuts were done with a combination of grey lead and fine liner, with the dark fine liner regions representing the cross section of the croissant.

        Using the section cuts, the elevation views were projected to an axonometric view. Overlaying a grid over the cuts and shearing to a 45-degree angle placed over an outline of the plan view provides a guide to draw the final view. Once again grey lead was used to render the final view.

        This task had us use a range of techniques to represent the form of a croissant. Starting with the photos, taking all the views needed to have a sufficient representation of the form required multiple elevations and a plan view along side annotations to show the scale, and the relation between all the views. Then various drawing techniques were explored to best represent the different views. The fine liner in the plan view came out nicely, although some more care could have been taken with the fine liner on the section cuts, as the thick sections are not quite accurate to the croissant itself. The form of the axonometric came out nicely, although once again more care could have been taken doing the rendering, to get a more sophisticated and detailed drawing.
