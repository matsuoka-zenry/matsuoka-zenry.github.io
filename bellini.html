        A sample of a painting and 3d geometry of Tasmania was provided as the basis for this task. Looking at the cloth in the painting, a large focus was on the convergence of the cloth fold, as well as the secondary material draped over on the side. The terrain also has some interesting qualities, but through the processes of the task was lost to fit the painting sample.

        An iterative processed was used on each of the studies. Constant reference back to the original sample was done to make sure the transformations done complimented the sample and didn’t get off track. In choosing the final iterations, the final composition and buildability was kept in mind, so simpler geometry was chosen. While more complex geometry would have resulted in a more interesting design, given the constraints with buildability complex geometry wasn’t pursued so efforts could be focused on other aspects of the design.

        The geometry was unfolded into 2-dimensional panels, to theoretically be built. All the pieces were arranged onto sheets in such a way to save as much material as possible. Each piece is labelled and can be traced back to the original geometry.

        The top view of the mesh was overlaid onto the painting sample to produce the final composite. The composite makes clear the convergence point in the cloth influencing the geometry. Additionally, the lower drape on the right is complemented by the larger flat top meshes. The painting sample was also extended beyond the original sample area using photoshop to match the shape of the geometry.

        This task had us thinking about the merging of 3-dimensional geometry and 2 dimensional pattern. The way I approached it was more so thinking about the pattern / painting sample to have 3 dimensional qualities to it, rather than vice versa. This allowed the artifact process to follow from the implied geometry of the sample, so once combined it is more or less cohesive.
Combining the two together in the final composite does lose a lot of the 3 dimensionality of the artifact as it is just a 2 dimensional snapshot of the geometry. Despite this the texture of the sample in addition with the overlay of the geometry helps keep some of the 3-dimensionality lost.
An interesting result of the composite is the jagged edges jutting out of the sample. Especially for the cloth on the bottom right, this allows for the sample to be extended beyond the initial square in a unique way, following form the geometry.
