        The main elements chosen include the pipe, coin, note block, hill, grass and ground. For the pip, hill and ground I went with a more direct approach in recreating them, as they are more fundamental elements of the world. For the coin, note block and grass I abstracted them a bit more to explore more hidden depth within the item itself. Looking at the elevations I interpreted the lighting to be that of a sunset, so when choosing my colour palette I went with a lot of warm colours.

        The process of drawing the axonometric view started with visualizing a plan view, to have a guide on how to start on the depth not shown. This plan view was then extruded up following the elevations provided, making sure the elements match. Once all broad strokes from the elevation was in place further detail was added in between the lines to flesh out the drawing. The first attempt was a bit lopsided in the overall composition so the drawing was recreated for the final drawing with the balance of the piece in mind.

        The shading process done in illustrator was done in multiple passes, starting with focusing of the form and shapes of all the elements, then slowly layering on colours and shading. Care was taken to make sure that the shading is coherent in the overall world, focusing on the sunset lighting. A combination of soft and hard shadows were used, as well as mimicking ambient occlusion to flesh out the depth of the illustration.

        This task had us taking 2-dimensional elevations and extending them into 3-dimensional axonometric view. This allowed us to abstract certain elements as we are adding depth that can’t be shown in elevation views. Doing the rendering process in illustrator was also quite interesting as it is still a 2-dimensional drawing, so techniques using gradients and masks were used to create the effect of depth. On reflection I could have added more intricate smaller details, although it may have cluttered the overall composition. In the end I’m quite happy with the overall effect of the rendering, as it is quite cohesive and doesn’t have a harsh, flat look that illustrator drawings often have.
